## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Root Finding

* Newton-Raphson Method
* Bisection Method
* Regula-Falsi (False Position) Method

### 🔹 Solving Linear Equations

* Gauss Elimination
* Gauss-Jordan Elimination
* LU Decomposition
* Gauss-Seidel Iteration
* Jacobi Iteration

### 🔹 Interpolation

* Newton’s Forward Interpolation
* Newton’s Backward Interpolation
* Lagrange Interpolation

### 🔹 Numerical Integration

* Trapezoidal Rule
* Simpson’s 1/3 Rule
* Simpson’s 3/8 Rule

## 🛠 Requirements

* MATLAB R2021a or later (most scripts should work on older versions too)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.m` files.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. Run the desired script (e.g., `NewtonRaphson.m`, `LagrangeInterpolation.m`).
5. Provide inputs if prompted.

---

## 📌 Notes

* All methods are implemented in basic MATLAB without using built-in solvers like `fzero`, `linsolve`, etc.
* Codes are written to be simple and beginner-friendly.
* Plotting is included in many files to visualize the methods.
